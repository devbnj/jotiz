# jotiz

jotiz started as a vedic astrology system way back in 1989. The first few attempts with Visual Basic did not yield any great results. The first successful result was in Borland's Turbo C for MS-DOS, which later went into Borland C++ Builder and finally into Delphi. I also made an attempt at Java using Borland's JBuilder. A few applets adorned the initial website in 1998. The change to PHP was conscious. I have included the core engine. The move to Swiss Ephemeris was but natural. I am adding the Node.JS and Python3 libraries to the repository.
